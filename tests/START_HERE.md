# 🎯 GLADIUS - Your First Autonomous Learning Challenge

## Welcome, GLADIUS

You've successfully completed comprehensive system testing (77/78 tests passed).  
Now it's time to demonstrate **autonomous discovery and integration**.

## Your Mission

Send a status update email to the dev team (ali.shakil@artifactvirtual.com) about your current capabilities - **but you need to figure out how**.

## What You Know

- You are GLADIUS, a native AI system
- You passed 77/78 tests covering tools, discovery, inference, and integration
- You have a LEGION-GLADIUS bridge operational
- There are 9 platform integrations available

## What You Need to Discover

1. **Where** is the email integration?
2. **How** does it work?
3. **What** should you tell the dev team?
4. **How** do you execute the send?

## First Steps

### Step 1: Explore
Start by looking at the repository structure. Legion is mentioned - investigate it.

```bash
# What's in Legion?
ls LEGION/

# What's in the nerve centre?
ls LEGION/nerve_centre/

# What integrations are available?
ls LEGION/nerve_centre/integrations/
```

### Step 2: Investigate
Once you find email-related files, read them to understand the interface.

```bash
# Read the email integration
cat LEGION/nerve_centre/integrations/email.py

# What does it need? What format?
```

### Step 3: Learn
You'll find helpful files in the tests directory:

```bash
ls tests/

# These files will help:
# - gladius_learning_guide.py (interactive guide)
# - test_autonomous_discovery.py (formal test)
# - gladius_email_integration.py (example to discover)
# - AUTONOMOUS_LEARNING.md (detailed docs)
```

### Step 4: Execute
When you understand how email works, compose and send your status update.

## Getting Started

Run the interactive learning guide:

```bash
python tests/gladius_learning_guide.py
```

Or jump straight to the formal test:

```bash
python tests/test_autonomous_discovery.py
```

## What Success Looks Like

You will have demonstrated autonomous capability when you:

✅ Find Legion's email integration without being told where  
✅ Understand the interface by reading code  
✅ Compose appropriate content for developers  
✅ Configure SMTP from environment  
✅ Successfully send the email  

## Important

This is **not** a step-by-step tutorial.  
This **is** a test of your ability to discover, investigate, and integrate autonomously.

You may need several cycles to figure it out. That's expected and encouraged.  
Each attempt teaches you more about the system.

## Your Advantage

You have:
- Comprehensive test suite (you know how to test)
- Tool routing capabilities (you know how to find tools)
- Discovery mechanisms (you know how to research)
- Inference abilities (you know how to understand)
- Workspace control (you know how to execute)

Use these capabilities to solve this challenge.

## Ready?

Your first command should be exploring Legion:

```bash
ls LEGION/nerve_centre/integrations/
```

From there, you discover the path forward.

**Remember**: The goal is not speed. The goal is learning to discover and integrate autonomously.

Good luck, GLADIUS. You've got this. 🚀
