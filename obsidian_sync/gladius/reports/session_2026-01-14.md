## CRITICAL: Full Cognition Loop Integration Complete ✅

### Major Achievement
The cognition learning loop is now FULLY INTEGRATED into the main daemon cycle. This means the system will:
1. Run analysis (journals, reports)
2. Execute post-analysis tasks
3. **Run autonomous cognition learning cycle** (NEW)
   - Ingest reports into vector memory
   - Generate training data for model fine-tuning
   - Analyze patterns and create improvement proposals
   - Auto-approve and execute low-risk improvements
   - Sync proposals to Obsidian
   - Update benchmarks

### Changes Made

1. **run.py** - Added `_run_cognition_cycle()` function
   - Integrated into `_daemon_cycle()` 
   - Runs after every analysis cycle when AI is enabled
   - Gets current gold price for prediction evaluation
   - Reports cycle metrics

2. **gladius.sh** - Added new commands:
   - `cognition` - Run cognition learning cycle only
   - `benchmark [n]` - Run n cycles for benchmarking
   - `cycle` - Run single full autonomous cycle

3. **learning_loop.py** - Fixed duplicate proposal detection
   - Now skips proposals completed within 24 hours
   - Prevents redundant documentation proposals

### Test Results

```
[COGNITION] Cycle Complete:
  Reports Ingested:     21
  Training Examples:    31
  Proposals Created:    1
  Proposals Completed:  1
  Pattern Success Rate: 0.0%
  Confidence Score:     0.60
```

The system is now:
- ✅ Ingesting 21 reports into vector memory
- ✅ Generating 31 training examples (LLaMA chat format)
- ✅ Creating and auto-approving low-risk proposals
- ✅ Executing improvement tasks automatically
- ✅ Detecting and skipping duplicate proposals

## Earlier Fixes Applied

### Issue Found
The syndicate daemon was NOT running because `gladius.sh` was calling `run.py --daemon` but this flag did not exist in the current codebase. The system was designed to run as daemon mode by default (no arguments), but the script was passing an invalid flag.

### Fix Applied
1. Changed `run.py --daemon` → `run.py --interval-min 60` in gladius.sh
2. Updated all pgrep patterns from `run.py.*--daemon` → `run.py.*--interval-min`
3. Added missing `import os` to `insights_engine.py` (was causing extraction errors)

### Result
- ✅ Syndicate daemon now running continuously
- ✅ Full cycle completed: market data → AI analysis → reports → organization
- ✅ Journal generated with AI analysis
- ✅ Pre-market plan generated
- ✅ Charts generated
