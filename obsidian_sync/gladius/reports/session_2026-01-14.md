# Session Report: 2026-01-14

## Critical Fix Applied

### Issue Found
The syndicate daemon was NOT running because `gladius.sh` was calling `run.py --daemon` but this flag did not exist in the current codebase. The system was designed to run as daemon mode by default (no arguments), but the script was passing an invalid flag.

### Fix Applied
1. Changed `run.py --daemon` → `run.py --interval-min 60` in gladius.sh
2. Updated all pgrep patterns from `run.py.*--daemon` → `run.py.*--interval-min`
3. Added missing `import os` to `insights_engine.py` (was causing extraction errors)

### Result
- ✅ Syndicate daemon now running continuously (PID 563413)
- ✅ Full cycle completed: market data → AI analysis → reports → organization
- ✅ Journal_2026-01-13.md generated with AI analysis
- ✅ Pre-market plan generated
- ✅ Charts generated

## Summary

Codebase cleanup and migration to Artifact-Virtual organization completed.

## Actions Completed

### 1. Integration Testing
- ✅ Discord: Connected and tested (webhook working)
- ✅ Notion: Connected to PRECIOUS METALS COMPLEX database
- ⚠️ Facebook/Instagram: Requires proper OAuth flow (permissions issue)
- ⚠️ Twitter: OAuth 1.0a connector needs completion
- ⚠️ LinkedIn: Abstract methods not implemented
- ❌ YouTube: Not configured

### 2. Codebase Cleanup

**Removed:**
- Personal obsidian notes (7 files)
- Unrelated research files (4 files)
- Legacy projects: Arc, SATops
- VM documentation
- Old data/ingest files

**Moved:**
- Dev docs → Artifact/docs/
- Cthulu docs → projects/cthulu/

**Retained:**
- Core system: Syndicate, Automata, Cognition, Hektor
- Trading projects: Cthulu, Herald, GoldMax
- Research: mql5, Argmax

### 3. Remote Migration

**From:** `https://github.com/amuzetnoM/gladius.git`  
**To:** `https://github.com/Artifact-Virtual/GLADIUS.git`

Successfully pushed all 2,226 objects.

### 4. Critical Bug Fixes (This Session)
- ✅ Fixed `gladius.sh` daemon startup command
- ✅ Fixed `insights_engine.py` missing import
- ✅ Verified full autonomous cycle works

## Outstanding Tasks

1. **Complete Platform Connectors:**
   - Twitter: Implement OAuth 1.0a authentication
   - LinkedIn: Implement abstract methods
   - Facebook/Instagram: Complete OAuth flow

2. **Model Training:**
   - Continue SmolLM2-135M fine-tuning
   - Target: 100% tool routing accuracy
   - Generate more training data

3. **Self-Improvement Integration:**
   - Integrate self_improvement.py into main cycle
   - Test proposal → Discord consensus flow
   - Test email escalation

## Current Status

| Component | Progress |
|-----------|----------|
| Core Infrastructure | 85% |
| Cognition Engine | 85% |
| Syndicate (Research) | 95% ✅ |
| Automata (Publishing) | 70% |
| Arty (Engagement) | 50% |
| Digital Footprint | 30% |

**Overall: ~72%**

## Next Session Priorities

1. Integrate self-improvement into daemon cycle
2. Complete Twitter/LinkedIn OAuth implementations
3. Run 5 self-improvement cycles
4. Benchmark model performance
