# Session Report: 2026-01-13

> **Session Duration**: ~2 hours  
> **Focus**: Full Autonomy Cycle + Training + Documentation  
> **Status**: ✅ SUCCESS

---

## Executive Summary

This session achieved a major milestone: the Gladius system now has a fully operational cognition engine with native tool calling, pattern-based routing at 100% accuracy, and a complete self-improvement lifecycle. The system has been trained on 1,500 synthetic examples across 100 iterations.

---

## Completed Tasks

### 1. End-to-End Autonomy Test ✅
- Verified complete cycle: Cognition → Memory → Tools → Self-Improvement
- All 16 native tools functional
- Hektor VDB backend confirmed working
- 12 documents in vector store
- 5 databases connected

### 2. Native Model Training ✅
- **100 iterations** completed
- **1,500 examples** generated
- **100% routing accuracy** on test queries
- **14 tool patterns** consolidated
- Pattern model: `tool-router-consolidated.patterns.json`

### 3. Infrastructure ✅
- smollm
- Configured SMTP for email escalation
- Added git auto-push for Obsidian sync
- Created training script with detached execution

### 4. Documentation ✅
- Generated CHANGELOG.md from 153 commits
- Updated TODO with session status
- Created this session report
- Flight checklist at 65% completion

## Files Modified

- `/scripts/train_native_model.py` - Created
- `/docs/CHANGELOG.md` - Created
- `/.env` - Updated SMTP config
- `/Artifact/syndicate/src/cognition/self_improvement.py` - Added sync_and_push
- `/__private/todo.md` - Updated status

---

## Models Created

1. **Pattern Models** (x100): Individual iteration models
2. **Consolidated Model**: `tool-router-consolidated.patterns.json`
   - 14 tools covered
   - Fast pattern matching (<1ms)
   - 100% accuracy on test set

3. **Base GGUF**: `qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf`
   - 491MB downloaded
   - Ready for llama.cpp fine-tuning when available

---

## Configuration Added

```env
# SMTP (for high-impact escalation)
SMTP_HOST=mail.artifactvirtual.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=dev@artifactvirtual.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=amuzetnM@9492
EMAIL_ENABLED=true
```

---

## Remaining Work

### Critical Path
1. Configure Discord webhook for consensus
2. Test SMTP connection
3. Add social media API keys

### High Priority
1. Build Grafana dashboards
2. Complete React frontend
3. GCP Cthulu finalization

### Future
1. Digital footprint (artifactvirtual.com)
2. Full Ollama replacement with native GGUF
3. ERP integrations

---

## Recommendations

1. **Discord Webhook**: Add `DISCORD_CONSENSUS_WEBHOOK` to enable community voting
2. **Social Keys**: At least enable one platform for testing
3. **SMTP Test**: May need server-side configuration on artifactvirtual.com
4. **llama.cpp**: Build with finetune support for native GGUF training

---

## Next Session Goals

1. Enable at least 1 social platform
2. Test full publishing pipeline
3. Build Herald BTCUSD module
4. Grafana dashboard setup

## Chart Enhancement Update (22:25 UTC)

### Enhanced Charting Module
Successfully implemented comprehensive chart annotations:

1. **RSI Subplot**: 
   - Purple line with overbought (70) and oversold (30) threshold lines
   - Helps identify momentum extremes

2. **ADX Subplot**:
   - Cyan ADX line with trend strength threshold at 25
   - Green/Red DI+/DI- lines for directional movement
   
3. **Support/Resistance Detection**:
   - Auto-detects swing highs/lows
   - Clusters similar price levels
   - Draws horizontal lines at key levels
   
4. **Market Regime Detection**:
   - TRENDING: ADX > 25
   - VOLATILE: ATR > 2% of price
   - RANGING: Default low-volatility state

5. **Title Annotations**:
   - Current price, RSI, ADX, ATR values
   - Market regime indicator

### Technical Fix
- Resolved mplfinance panel_ratios mismatch when volume=True
- Panel numbering now correctly accounts for volume panel
- All 6 asset charts generating successfully

### Verification
```
