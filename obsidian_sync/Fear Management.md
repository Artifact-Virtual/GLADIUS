There is no healing on social media.

Healing is a natural phenomena.
Even if we recieve natural information in a hyper-quick unnatural way, its recieved abnormally. 
No good comes from mutation.
No good comes from ferminting fruit or chord.
Only cheap thrills.

Healing is natural. It comes from nature.
Only 1 thing is true in life, the events that are taking place. Truth, as we know it, is subjective to a group of people. What they believe, for themselves, is gospel. 

Healing comes from pain. Just like success comes from failure. 
Its just that one last try. Success is after that 1 last try. 

The only truth about life, is that
It grows and, unlike things within life, its unidirectional. 
Healing comes from understanding the difference. Its what got us all here in the first place. 
Understand, we are all alike even if we live lives of stars. Pain is real. 
And a Divine Teacher. Its larger than ourselves and greater than our families. 
Pain is personal. Its existential. When pain arrives, you can't leave. Pain is, then, persistent. 

Pain teaches many critical lessons. Crucially that dignity is the only thing a human being truly "needs". Not food, water or even air. Dignity is a product of Care. And is directly proportional to the honesty in it. Measured by the energy one puts into something. 
The only thing that will account for someone, is the amount of cloth on ones egg-naked body. Fetal or fatal.

We are all children of some other children. 
The truth about life, is growth. And life outgrows pain. Oppression. Weakness. Helplessness. It out grows the "need" to exist.

It, simply, does.

And,
You know you've healed when you realize you no longer ask questions about life but are the very person in charge of finding better ways... of answering them.
When you realize instead of letting your tears crash on the floor, you are the one who has to catch them.
In mid-air. 

What is power? If not the true understanding of ones own self.

Wings dont really need redbull. 
They need the fear of falling out of the sky.
