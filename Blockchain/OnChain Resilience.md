No Internet Connection Doesn't Mean No Web3 Economy. 

Here's your action plan on how to make on-chain transfers in case of an apocalypse ↓

#1 Data Broadcasting via Radio

Blockchain transactions can be broadcast via radio waves. By translating transaction data into radio signals, it can be sent and received by anyone with the necessary radio equipment.

#2 Mesh Networks

This decentralized communication network enables devices to connect directly with each other without a centralized internet provider. 

While slower, they can carry out simple tasks like sending on-chain transactions.

#3 SMS-Based Transactions

Some services allow users to perform transactions via SMS. By simply sending an SMS with the right command and details, you can send/receive money on-chain.

#4 Physical Transfer with Hardware Wallets

If both parties are present, a sender can sign a transaction offline using a hardware wallet, then physically give the recipient the transaction details to broadcast when they have internet access.

#5 USB Sneakernet

This involves physically moving data between devices. Create a transaction offline, save it on a USB drive, and then transport it to an online computer to broadcast.

#6 Ham Radio Transmissions

This old-school communication method has been used to transmit emails and can also be adapted for blockchain transactions, especially over long distances.

#7 Satellite Transmissions

Some companies are now launching satellites that can handle blockchain transactions. With the right equipment, you can send/receive transactions directly through these satellites.

We will keep grinding no matter what.
